 * `config/billing.php` and `platform_settings`; this file holds only what the
 * PROVIDER side of a payment needs — which provider answers, how long a pending
 * transaction may stay pending, how often a lost callback is retried, and which
 * callers a webhook is accepted from.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO SECRET IS EVER READ HERE OR STORED HERE (FR-010 · NFR-010). Credentials
 * and signing keys are environment variables read by the provider adapter that
 * needs them, and there is no adapter yet — the real gateway is deferred by the
 * owner's decision (Q8). A key defaulted to a string in this file would be a
 * secret in the repository, which is the thing FR-010 forbids.

    | `manual_transfer` looked right and matched nothing: the registry answers
    | 404 for an unknown id, so every charge on the platform returned "no such
    | route" while the code, the config and the registry each looked correct on
    | their own.
