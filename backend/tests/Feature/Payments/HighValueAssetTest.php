/*
| SC-011 · FR-041 … FR-044 — the independent control.
|
| The document's own words: "لا تُفتح إطلاقاً وعلى الحساب رصيد مستحق، حتى لو كانت
| الحصص نفسها مفتوحة". Three claims, failing in three directions:
|
|   · the classified file is refused WITH the number and the way to pay, while the
|     ordinary file beside it opens — the control is on the asset, not the person;
|   · the paid-up course is untouched. Withholding is per COURSE, and answering per
|     workspace would close a course nobody owes a riyal on;
|   · the check runs at every issue, and the lift needs no job — the next attempt
|     after payment simply succeeds.
