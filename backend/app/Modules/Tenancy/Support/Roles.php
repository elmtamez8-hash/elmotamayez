     * which is the split Q-4 moved to the platform in the first place.
     *
     * It holds approval and nothing else. A finance role that could also price a
     * package, move a credit ceiling or switch a billing mode would be a second
     * super-admin wearing a narrower name — and each of those three decides how
     * much the PLATFORM may be owed, which is not a clerical act.

     * teacher they study with — so an officer scoped to a team could only ever
     * fulfil a fraction of one, and "the partial export" is not a right that has
     * been implemented.
     *
     * ⚠️ AND WITHOUT IT `FR-026`'s "who executed this" IS ONE PERSON. The five
     * compliance permissions reach `super-admin` through `Permissions::all()`
     * alone; with no second role there is exactly one account on the platform that
     * can execute an erasure, and the audit column records that account for every
     * request ever made. A record that always names the same person records
     * nothing.
     *
     * It holds the five compliance permissions and nothing else. Not the finance
     * ones — reading a child's whole file and approving a payment are different
     * jobs — and composing either role from the other would hand each the other's.
