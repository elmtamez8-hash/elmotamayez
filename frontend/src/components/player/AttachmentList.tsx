/**
 * The files that come with an item, from the student's side.
 *
 * No URL is carried in this list, and that is the design: every attachment is
 * opened by asking for a grant at the moment the student clicks, and the address
 * that comes back stops working minutes later. A list of ready-made links would
 * be the permanent path FR-034 forbids, arriving through the back door of a
 * convenience.
 *
 * So the button does the asking. One extra round-trip, and no link on the page
 * that outlives the session it was drawn in.

        `noopener` alone, and dropping `noreferrer` is the point.

        ⚠️ THIS URL IS A REDIRECT FOR ANY COMMERCIAL PROVIDER, AND THAT PROVIDER
        REFUSES A REQUEST WITH NO `Referer` — measured against a real zone on
        2026-08-18: a correctly signed URL answers 403 without the header and 200
        with any value at all. `noreferrer` suppresses it for the navigation and for
        the redirect that follows, so an attachment stored at the CDN would open a
        vendor error page instead of the file, with nothing in our logs.

        Nothing is lost: `noopener` is the half that matters — it keeps the new tab
        from reaching back through `window.opener` — and the referrer we are
        withholding here is our own origin, from a link we built ourselves.
